## Exercise 5 in the Variables Chapter


x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

In this program x is initialized outside the block and manipulated inside.
Because x was initialized outside the block, and a variable initiated outside a block is still in scope in the block, 
the output will be 3.


y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

In this case, x is not a recognized variable in the main program. x was initialized inside the block, and is out of scope for the main program.
