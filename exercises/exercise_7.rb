#What is the difference between an Array and a Hash?

# answer:
# an array is an ordered list of values, referenced by an index that is an integer, and starts at base 0
# a hash is a list of key value pairs, where the key is used to reference the value in a hash. keys can be of any data type.

###Book answer
#The major difference between an array and a hash is that a hash contains a key value pair for referencing by key.
