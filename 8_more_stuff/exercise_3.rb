# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
# Answer: Exception handling is the process of predictively handling any error that may occur in a program.
# It solves the problem of unexpected behavior when interacting with the outside world, or any unpredicatable behavior that may make its way into the program.
# Solution from book: Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
